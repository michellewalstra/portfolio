            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="c-user-research align-left section">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>By analyzing Google Analytics I found that <strong>“77% of site search queries in the past year were for products”</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>Based on the above statistic, the primary user journey is searching for product & price and our search results should cater for that.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="c-ui align-left">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Proposed Design</h2>
            <p>There were some complexities that had to be overcome when brainstorming ideas. Due to the independent pricing business modal of SPAR stores (each store can have it's own pricing for the same product), we couldn't just show the price on the product when a user searched.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As part of my normal design process, I start with a paper prototype away from my desk (usually outside). I then move onto wireframes and after collaborating with my design team and iterating on the wireframes, I move onto high fidelity mock-ups in Figma (or Sketch before 2020).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Below is the before and after of the proposed design solution:</p>
        </div>
    </div>

        <div class="half">
            <img src="../img/2.Specials-screenshot.png" alt="">
            <div class="caption">Before - searching products returned no results</div>
        </div>
        <div class="half">
            <img src="../img/2.Specials-figma.gif" alt="">
            <div class="caption">After - products are shown and store-specific price</div>
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="c-outcome align-left section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>The client was happy with the proposed user journey, however the project was parked as the product data we were receiving from SPAR's third-party data provider was not sufficient yet. There was still quite a bit of work to be done on their side to ingest the data in a meaningful way on the SPAR website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And so we waited...</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="break"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="c-update">
        <h1>2021</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="section align-left p-t-70">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>A Quick Update</h2>
            <p>The third-party data provider had done the work required and our dev team had tested the APIs to ensure that what we were receiving would be sufficient to pull off the desired outcome.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As this was a new year, and the proposed solution was almost a year old, I decided to re-evaluate the original solution to see if we could make it better.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After watching the latest bunch of Hotjar user recordings, I noticed that users search with a specific result in mind. If a user searched and there were store results, it was highly probable that the user was looking for a store. It was unlikely that the user searched ‘Hillcrest’ to find anything other than a store. They may have also been searching for a store or area to find specials, so showing stores first still made sense as the user could view all the specials on that store's page.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="c-strategy align-left section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>UX Strategy & Ideation</h2>
            <p>There needed to be clever logic to determine the order of search results based on the search query and results returned.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>The proposed ordering of search result types:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stores</li>
                <li>Deals (product & price)
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the most common search type based on analytics</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Rewards - should search national and regional rewards (based on store in context)</li>
                <li>Recipes</li>
                <li>Posts</li>
                <li>Web pages e.g. Careers</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="c-ui align-left">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Instead of showing products and articles all together, I separated the types of results into tabs in order of priority, for e.g. we know most users are looking for specials, so show specials first.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Specials are shown in the context of the user’s favourite stores
                    <ul>
                        <li>User has the ability to add/remove stores by clicking ‘Change stores’ link</li>
                        <li>If there are no specials, the tab will not be shown</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img class="p-t-50" src="../img/2.Specials-wireframe.png" alt="">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="align-left p-b-50">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Final UI</h2>
            <p>By the time the design team were ready to work on the high fidelity mock-ups, I had been promoted to Chief of Operations, so my role in the design team had changed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I briefed one of our UX designers in on the work and worked closely with him to finalize the UI. We met regularly for feedback sessions and I helped ensure that the final solution was usable and easy-to-understand. (See below for the final approved design)</p>
            <br>
            <p>I put together a user journey map, indicating all the possible user scenarios, and took our development team through it at a kick-off meeting. I am heavily involved with the dev team when they are working on a piece of work that I've spearheaded. We follow the agile process so are constantly iterating on the final feature and touching base with the client as we go. </p>
            <br>
            <p>As it stands today (August 2021), the project is currently being reviewed by the client's Change Management Board and we should have approval to deploy next week 🤞.</p>
